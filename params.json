Designed and run by a community of researchers from a variety of organizations, these challenges invite participants to propose solutions â€” fostering collaboration and building communities in the process. The [Olfaction Prediction Challenge](http://dreamchallenges.org/project/dream-odor-classification-challenge) was organized by Pablo Meyer to build predictive models based upon data [collected and made available](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12868-016-0287-2) by Andreas Keller and Leslie Vosshall. Details and results of the challenge are described [here](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2811262).\r\n\r\n### Code\r\nAll code for training models and eliciting predictions used in the most successful challenge algorithms, as well as associated experimental data, is available in [this repository](https://github.com/dream-olfaction/olfaction-prediction).  It also includes Jupyter notebooks for reproducing the content of figures found in the manuscript.  \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis page is maintained by the @dream-olfaction consortium. Specific questions about the organization or execution of code can be directed to @rgerkin.",
